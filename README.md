# MyGatePass: Pre-Approve Frequent MyGate Deliveries

## Overview
**MyGatePass** allows you to quickly and easily pre-approve frequent deliveries on MyGate without the need to purchase their Premium plan. By leveraging MyGate's API, this tool provides a seamless way to automate the pre-approval process for specific delivery companies, saving you time and enhancing convenience.

## How It Works
* **OTP Authentication:** Enter your mobile number to receive an OTP. Verify the OTP to authenticate with MyGate using their official API.
* **Automated Pre-Approvals:** The tool uses MyGate's one-time approval flow and programmatically creates multiple pre-approval requests for different future dates.
* **Customizable Delivery Windows:** Specify the delivery company, start and end times, and the number of days you want the pre-approval to be valid.
